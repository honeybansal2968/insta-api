  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>Effective Date: August 15, 2025</p>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our Meta developer webhook integration.
    We value your privacy and are committed to protecting any data received through our application.
  </p>

  <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>
    When our webhook receives events from Meta (Facebook, Instagram, etc.), we may temporarily process:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Event data sent by Meta's servers (e.g., object type, event type, timestamps).</li>
    <li>Publicly available information provided by Meta's APIs.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    We do <strong>not</strong> collect personal information directly from users through our webhook.
  </p>

  <h2>How We Use the Information</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>To process and respond to webhook events.</li>
    <li>To ensure our app functions as intended with Meta's API.</li>
    <li>For debugging and error handling.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Data Retention</h2>
  <p>
    We store webhook event data only as long as necessary to process the event. No personal data is stored permanently unless required for app functionality and permitted by Meta's policies.
  </p>

  <h2>Sharing of Information</h2>
  <p>
    We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer webhook event data to outside parties, except as required by law or to comply with Metaâ€™s platform policies.
  </p>

  <h2>Security</h2>
  <p>
    We take reasonable measures to secure webhook data, including using HTTPS encryption for all data transfers.
  </p>

  <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated effective date.
  </p>
